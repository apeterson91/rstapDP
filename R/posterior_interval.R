#' Posterior uncertainty intervals
#'
#' The \code{posterior_interval} function computes Bayesian posterior uncertainty
#' intervals. These intervals are often referred to as \emph{credible}
#' intervals. This text is inspired by the same function documentation from \pkg{rstanarm}.
#'
#' @aliases posterior_interval
#' @export
#'
#' @param object stapDP object
#' @param prob A number \eqn{p \in (0,1)}{p (0 < p < 1)} indicating the desired
#'   probability mass to include in the intervals. The default is to report
#'   \eqn{95}\% intervals (\code{prob=0.95}).
#' @param pars vector of parameter names
#' @param ... ignored
#'
#' @return A matrix with two columns and as many rows as model parameters (or
#'   the subset of parameters specified by \code{pars}. 
#'   For a given value of \code{prob}, \eqn{p}, the columns
#'   correspond to the lower and upper \eqn{100p}\% interval limits and have the
#'   names \eqn{100\alpha/2}\% and \eqn{100(1 - \alpha/2)}\%, where \eqn{\alpha
#'   = 1-p}. For example, if \code{prob=0.95} is specified (a \eqn{95}\%
#'   interval), then the column names will be \code{"2.5\%"} and \code{"97.5\%"},
#'   respectively.

#' \subsection{Interpretation}{
#' Unlike for a frenquentist confidence interval, it is valid to say that,
#' conditional on the data and model, we believe that with probability \eqn{p}
#' the value of a parameter is in its \eqn{100p}\% posterior interval. This
#' intuitive interpretation of Bayesian intervals is often erroneously applied
#' to frequentist confidence intervals. See Morey et al. (2015) for more details
#' on this issue and the advantages of using Bayesian posterior uncertainty
#' intervals (also known as credible intervals).
